# Otium 🧘‍♂️

**Reclaiming the Biological Capacity to Think.**

Otium is a biology-aligned focus and recovery system built for the modern digital age. Unlike traditional app blockers that treat symptoms, Otium addresses the biological cause of digital fatigue by enforcing a scientifically grounded loop of deep focus and intentional recovery.

---

## 🚀 The Vision: Beyond "Negotium"
The global workforce is trapped in **Negotium** — a state of constant, non-enjoyable digital busyness. With attention switching every 47 seconds and an annual $1.3 trillion productivity loss, we need more than just timers; we need biological restoration.

**Otium is not an app blocker. It is a cognitive rhythm optimizer.**

---

## 🔄 The One Loop (MVP)
Otium is structured around a single, powerful biological loop:
**Focus → Detect → Recover → Reflect**

1.  **Focus**: Start a 90-minute deep work sprint.
2.  **Detect**: Behind-the-scenes monitoring of interaction patterns to sense cognitive fatigue.
3.  **Recover**: Enforced 15-minute recovery mode sessions (no escape, no screen).
4.  **Reflect**: Self-reported clarity tracking to measure progress over time.

## ✨ Features

### 1. Adaptive Onboarding
Identifies your "Cognitive Risk Profile" based on your role (Student, Knowledge Worker, Creator, etc.) to tailor the sensing logic.

### 2. Deep Focus Sprints
A minimal, distraction-free environment for ultradian-aligned deep work.

### 3. Fatigue Sensing & Micro-Intervention
Proprietary logic detects "tap bursts" and rapid context-switching. If you show signs of overload *during* a sprint, Otium triggers a 60-second breathing reset.

### 4. Enforced Recovery Mode ⭐
The "Wow" moment. When a sprint ends or fatigue threshold is crossed, the app locks into a beautiful, non-escapable recovery screen, nudging you towards analog restoration (movement, nature, stillness).

### 5. Reclaim Dashboard
Visual proof of your improved clarity and uninterrupted focus hours.
